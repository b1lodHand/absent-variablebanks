You can open the Package Manager via the: **'Window/Package Manager'** menu on the toolbar of Unity itself. Also, you can find the documentation of these tools in the same links above.

### Installing and Documentation

Because of it's **asset management** aspect, I can't just say: "click this, and that and you have it!" with this package. So, I will lead you to it's own website hosted on github-pages. There, you will learn what you need to know in order to set this tool up properly.

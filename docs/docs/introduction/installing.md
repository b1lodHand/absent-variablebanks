# Installing

In this section of the documentation, you will learn how to install this tool and get it ready to use.

>[!NOTE]
>If you've already installed the package, you can skip this section and go to [Mechanism](https://b1lodhand.github.io/absent-variablebanks/docs/getting-started/mechanism.html).

## Prerequisites
First of all, this tool depends on some of my other tools. No, no, no, no! Don't run away! They are so lightweight and easy to setup.

```

```
```

```
```

```
All you need to do is copying the URLs above and pasting them into you package manager.

You can open the Package Manager via the: **'Window/Package Manager'** menu on the toolbar of Unity itself. Also, you can find the documentation of these tools in the same links above.

## Installing the Package
So, you've installed all the things necessary to run this tool. Now, it is the time of installing the tool itself.

This step is pretty much straightforward:

1. Go to: https://github.com/b1lodHand/absent-variablebanks/releases

2. Find the the best release for you (I'd recommend the latest).

3. Download the ".unitypackage" in that release by clicking and open that file with Unity.

4. **You have it!**
